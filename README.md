# Mod4 Take Home Challenge

## Introduction
This is a take-home challenge meant to simulate what sort of challenges I may see during interview processes while I am job hunting.  For this challenge, I was tasked with consuming the [New York Times Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview), and displaying a list of these top stories on my app.  The user should be able to filter the stories based on their 'section' labels, and then click on a story in the list to see more details about the story.  The details page also includes a link to the full article on the NY Times website.  This challenge is meant to be completed in 8 hours or less, and is not meant to be fancy or complex, but rather just show that I can follow a well-thought-out process in a limited amount of time.

## Skills to Showcase
The main skills that are meant to be showcased by completing this challenge are:
- A strong understanding of React JS and Front-End best practices
- My ability to prioritize for MVP
- An understanding of basic usability practices and standards
- A clear hierarchy of information
- Clean, well thought out code
